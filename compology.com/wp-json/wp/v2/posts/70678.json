Before we optimized waste measurement from our monitoring systems, our estimates assumed that bins were full each time they were emptied, leading us to overestimate waste by as much as 50 percent. We also found that products often ended up in the wrong bins.

It assumes that<em> all dumpsters are 100% full at pickup.<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>While this type of assumption may have made sense when waste and recycling oversight was difficult at scale due to limited vendor transparency and data sharing, the more recent proliferation of remote dumpster monitoring technology and readily accessible waste and recycling data, at scale, makes inaccurate reporting not only irresponsible, but also costly.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Eighty million Compology data points reveal that dumpsters are actually serviced at an average of 46 percent fullness (not 100 percent), meaning reporting on waste production and diversion rates using the industry standard, to date, has been inaccurate by more than half!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In fact, Apple Inc., an industry pioneer in sustainability and environmental responsibility, confirms in their <a href=\"https:\/\/www.apple.com\/environment\/pdf\/Apple_Environmental_Progress_Report_2020.pdf\">2020 Environmental Progress Report<\/a> this is true for them, too! By monitoring their waste, they\u2019ve identified they are not generating as much waste as they\u2019ve been reporting, overestimating waste production by as much as 50 percent!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple focuses their environmental work in three interconnected areas\u2014climate change, resources and smarter chemistry\u2014driving their mission to \u201cmake products without taking from the earth.\u201d Specifically, in 2018, Apple launched their commitment to send zero waste to landfill for their offices, retail stores, and data centers.<\/p>\n\n\n<section class=\"quote-component mt-lg-5 mt-xl-5 mb-xl-5 mb-lg-5 mt-md-1 mb-md-1 mt-sm-1 mb-sm-1 mt-xs-1 mb-xs-1\">\n    <div class=\"container-fluid\">\n        <div class=\"row ml-md-1 mr-md-1 ml-sm-1 ml-xs-1 mr-sm-1 mr-xs-1 ml-lg-5 ml-xl-5 mr-xl-5 mr-lg-5\">\n            <div class=\"col-12 col-md-8 mx-auto\">\n                <blockquote class=\"blockquote \">\n                    <p class=\"quotation-mark \">We\u2019ve installed remote waste monitoring systems to accurately measure waste generation and contamination.<\/p>\n                                            <h2 class=\"mb-0\">\n                                                            APPLE&#8217;S 2020 ENVIRONMENTAL PROGRESS REPORT                        <\/h2>\n                                    <\/blockquote>\n            <\/div>\n        <\/div>\n    <\/div>\n<\/section>\n\n\n\n<p>Compology\u2019s waste metering<sup>TM<\/sup> technology is helping Apple automate and standardize accurate waste output measurement to 1) improve waste, recycling and diversion reporting with readily available, reliable data 2) reduce hauling costs by reducing service levels to actual waste production and identifying and getting credit for missed pickups, and 3) reduce contamination and incorrect disposal in each dumpster as it happens to improve recycling rates, reduce contamination fines and educate employees about recycling best practices. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In other words, Compology\u2019s waste metering technology equips Apple with accurate, data-driven proof that they\u2019re producing less waste than previously believed\u2014a huge win for their operations, procurement and sustainability teams alike!&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cImagine making investment decisions with financial data that was inaccurate by 50 percent,\u201d says Jason Gates, CEO of Compology. \u201cThe industry is ripe for standardized data collection and reporting methodologies to meet business needs and the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.epa.gov\/americarecycles\/us-national-recycling-goal\">EPA\u2019s<\/a> new, aggressive national recycling goals. We\u2019re thrilled Apple, McDonald\u2019s and other leading brands are exposing the vast opportunity to meter waste for automated, accurate waste production measurement and transparent reporting to shareholders and consumers.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Check out <a href=\"http:\/\/compology.com\/compology-and-esg\/\">four other leading companies&#8217;
