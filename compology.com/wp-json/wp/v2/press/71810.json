Launched as part of the City\u2019s ambitious efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 60% by 2035, the waste metering partnership is on track to increase recycling rates by 50% and cut thousands of tons of CO2 and methane emissions, while saving taxpayer dollars.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Each year, <em>Fast Company<\/em>\u2019s editors and writers highlight groundbreaking projects that are positively impacting communities around the world. For the first time, <em>Fast Company<\/em> added a new Climate category to put a special emphasis on the ideas that are helping to fight climate change and better our planet. Past World Changing Ideas include Regeneron\u2019s COVID-19 antiviral medication, Solidia\u2019s carbon capture concrete, and food waste reduction app Too Good To Go.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>How we manage waste is often an afterthought in the fight against climate change despite the fact that landfills are the third largest emitter of methane emissions in the United States. Prior to implementing Compology\u2019s waste metering technology, the City of Miami had no way to accurately measure how much waste it was producing. As part of the initiative, Compology installed its rugged smart cameras in commercial dumpsters and recycling bins across the City. Leveraging AI, Compology then provided the CIty with data-driven insights to enable tracking and reduction of waste, improved recycling and reduced carbon emissions from unnecessary waste to landfill and unnecessary garbage truck miles traveled.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m honored that Fast Company recognized our City\u2019s partnership with Compology as a World Changing Idea. We\u2019ve seen tremendous results already and are in the process of expanding the initiative across businesses throughout the City,\u201d said Miami City Commissioner Ken Russell. \u201cMiami is becoming one of the country\u2019s innovation hubs, so it\u2019s only appropriate that our City also leverages technology to reduce our environmental impact and save taxpayers money.\u201d&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cI applaud the City of Miami, Mayor Francis Suarez, and Commissioner Ken Russell for implementing technology that has a measurable impact on both the environment as well as the City\u2019s budget,\u201d&nbsp; said Jason Gates, Compology CEO. \u201cWith technological innovations like waste metering, we can take steps right now that will help reduce our greenhouse gas emissions and drive lasting change.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>About Compology:<br><\/strong>As the leading provider of smart camera and artificial intelligence solutions in waste and transportation, Compology helps move the world\u2019s raw material, finished goods and waste with the smallest footprint possible.
