The list recognizes the most inspiring and innovative leaders in the waste management industry today. A change maker at the cutting edge of sustainable waste management, Reza has launched impressive partnerships to implement Compology\u2019s waste metering technology across major cities and Fortune 500 companies with the goal of making waste metering a standard practice across the United States.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>By outfitting dumpsters with smart cameras that use AI to track dumpster fill levels and measure waste production, Compology modernizes the US\u2019s outdated waste management infrastructure to promote sustainability and reduce costs. Compology\u2019s technology allows both businesses and governments to track and reduce landfill-bound waste, increase recycling, and rightsize dumpster service schedules to drive cost effective and environmentally friendly waste management solutions.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>By spearheading major partnerships with both cities and corporations, Reza is helping bring waste metering into the mainstream and changing the conversation on how we manage our waste sustainably. Recently, Reza spearheaded a partnership with Miami to implement a waste metering pilot program to meter the City\u2019s waste, improve recycling rates and help the City meet its aggressive sustainability and carbon reduction goals. Initial results from the pilot predict a 50% increase in recycling rates at dozens of municipal buildings and thousands of tons of C02 reduced.<br><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>He has also worked with companies like McDonald\u2019s, Starbucks, and Nordstrom to outfit retail dumpsters with waste metering technology, analyze data to reduce dumpster pickups, and ultimately cut carbon emissions. Under his leadership, waste metering is helping innovative companies like <a href=\"https:\/\/compology.com\/blog\/hear-it-from-apple-we-were-overestimating-waste\/\">Apple<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/compology.com\/fortune-500-grainger-features-waste-metering-impact-in-2021-esg-report\/\">Grainger<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/compology.com\/customer-story\/raytheon-technologies-uses-waste-metering-technology-to-achieve-2025-sustainability-goals\/\">Raytheon<\/a> achieve their CSR and ESG goals.\u00a0 Reza has also helped bring real time recycling information to multifamily housing properties through several innovative partnerships with property management companies.\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jason Gates, CEO and co-founder of Compology, said, \u201cReza\u2019s place on the 40 Under 40 List is well deserved. His efforts and dedication have been instrumental in bringing waste metering to companies and cities across the country and Compology&#8217;s success. Throughout his tenure at Compology, Reza has worked tirelessly to help cities and companies transform their waste management practices, save money, and adopt more sustainable practices.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Reza Kashani said, \u201cI\u2019m honored to be recognized on Waste360\u2019s 40 Under 40 list. I\u2019m excited to be a part of the team that is helping advance the waste management industry by standardizing the metering and reporting of waste, recycling and organics, enabling waste to be treated similar to other utilities such as water, electricity, and gas.\u201d&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>About Compology:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As the leading provider of smart camera and artificial intelligence solutions in waste and transportation, Compology helps move the world\u2019s raw material, finished goods and waste with the smallest footprint possible.
