The Congressional Recycling Caucus, co-chaired in the House by Representatives Frank Pallone (D-NJ-06), David Joyce (R-OH-14), Haley Stevens (D-MI-11), and Rodney Davis (R-IL-13) and in the Senate by Senators Tom Carper (D-D.E.) and John Boozman (R-Ark.), is a bipartisan and bicameral caucus whose focus is to educate members of Congress and congressional staff on the need for recycling and its environmental and economical benefits, and to support public policies aimed at increasing recycling across the United States.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As a result of outdated infrastructure, much of the country\u2019s waste ends up in landfills, which are responsible for 15% of the United States\u2019 total methane emissions. While many European countries recycle more than half of their total waste, the US recycles less than a third. Decades of disinvestment in green technology and poor recycling education leaves many recycling facilities unable to properly sort highly contaminated materials, ultimately diverting <a href=\"https:\/\/news.climate.columbia.edu\/2020\/03\/13\/fix-recycling-america\/\">30%<\/a> of recyclable materials directly into landfills.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As one of the foremost innovators in the recycling and waste industry, Gates provided attendees with an overview on how Compology\u2019s waste metering technology, powered by smart camera and artificial intelligence, mitigates this problem and helps ensure contaminants are identified and removed prior to waste collection, making sure more recyclables (and less waste) enter&nbsp;recycling facilities. He demonstrated how waste metering can help meet the five objectives the EPA outlined in their 2021 National Recycling Strategy. He also highlighted that similar to how the metering of water, gas, and electricity fundamentally overhauled how consumers, businesses and governments use and pay for these utilities, waste metering can deliver the same benefits for waste and recycling management.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><p class=\"editor-header\">Gates also shared exciting results from Compology\u2019s recent launch with the City of Miami. The City implemented waste metering across its municipal dumpsters to reduce CO2 emissions, traffic congestion, noise pollution and illegal dumping, while improving code compliance and enhancing urban beautification efforts. Gates shared that initial results from the pilot predicted a 50% increase in recycling rates at dozens of municipal buildings and thousands of tons of C02 reduced.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cI greatly appreciated the opportunity to brief key congressional staff on the waste and recycling industry and opportunities for modernization. It\u2019s encouraging to discuss the ways the federal government can partner with waste metering providers, like Compology, to generate $1-2 billion in taxpayer savings and drive our national recycling goals. We\u2019re already helping businesses and local governments save money, reduce greenhouse gas emissions and more sustainably manage their waste and recycling and believe in the exponential impact waste metering can have at scale,\u201d said Jason Gates. \u201cWe value the dedication of the Congressional Recycling Caucus in tackling these important issues in a bipartisan, bicameral way, and look forward to working with members of the caucus to advance smart, commonsense policies that promote increased recycling and smarter waste management.\u201d\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><p class=\"editor-header\">Gates went on to highlight how 1,300 brands including McDonald\u2019s, Apple, and Google have already implemented waste metering technology to report on waste and recycling and reduce their organization\u2019s environmental footprint, improve recycling rates, and rightsize their waste service, thereby eliminating unnecessary pickups and cutting costs. Gates highlighted how the impactful environmental and cost saving results experienced by the private sector can be replicated in the public sector.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><p class=\"editor-header\"><strong>About Compology:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As the leading provider of smart camera and artificial intelligence solutions in waste and transportation, Compology helps move the world\u2019s raw material, finished goods and waste with the smallest footprint possible.
