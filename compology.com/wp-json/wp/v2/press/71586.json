In partnership with ZTERS and Latipac, this initiative modernizes waste management infrastructure, increasing recycling rates, boosting sustainability, and reducing operating costs.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A certified B Corporation, Compology provides waste metering by outfitting dumpsters with smart cameras that measure and analyze dumpster fill levels and contents. Compology then provides clients with data-driven, sustainable, and cost-effective waste management plans to rightsize dumpster pick up schedules, which both cuts costs from excessive dumpster service and reduces carbon emissions from unnecessary garbage truck miles. In addition, Compology also alerts waste managers to recycling contamination, ensuring that items are placed in the correct waste stream and ultimately improving recycling rates.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>ZTERS, a leading national waste broker based in Houston, TX, recently implemented Compology\u2019s technology across Latipac\u2019s shopping centers and commercial real estate properties, which include Starbucks, Subway, Dunkin\u2019 Donuts, and 24 Hour Fitness in order to save money and promote sustainability. By implementing waste metering in these heavily trafficked malls, Latipac is helping to improve their recycling rates while keeping unnecessary dump trucks off the streets, in turn limiting CO2 emissions. This sustainable solution also translates into operational cost reductions, saving each Latipac shopping center of thousands of dollars a year by eliminating excessive dumpster pickups.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><p class=\"editor-header\">\u201cImplementing waste metering is a win-win decision: It reduces our environmental impact while also saving our client money,\u201d said Dan Studer, Commercial Waste Services Division Manager of ZTERS. \u201cWhile we\u2019ve long been forward thinking in using technology to help improve our clients\u2019 efficiency, with Compology, we\u2019re able to help Latipac improve their sustainability as well.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cLatipac is leading the way in adopting common sense sustainability measures. Waste metering cuts costs while also improving recycling rates and limiting carbon emissions across commercial locations, demonstrating that companies can do well financially while doing good for the environment. I commend ZTERS and Latipac\u2019s commitment to bringing smart, green infrastructure across Texas&#8217;s leading cities,\u201d said Jason Gates, CEO and co-founder of Compology.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>About Compology:<\/strong> As the leading provider of smart camera- and artificial intelligence solutions in waste and transportation, Compology helps move the world\u2019s raw material, finished goods and waste with the smallest footprint possible.
