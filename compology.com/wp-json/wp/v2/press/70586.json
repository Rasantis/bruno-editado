And with accurate metrics they can share the positive impact they are having on our environment through their sustainability and CSR reports.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cWe\u2019re honored to work with innovators like Rob and the New Market Waste team who embrace technology to meet client demands proactively, especially when waste levels have fluctuated as drastically as we\u2019ve seen in 2020,\u201d said Compology CEO Jason Gates. \u201cWe look forward to all of the opportunities ahead bringing efficiency, sustainability and bottom line impact to them and their clients.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>One notable client success story is Fortune 1000 company, <a href=\"https:\/\/compology.com\/customer-stories\/how-adt-security-saves-53-on-waste-costs-annually-with-compology\/\">ADT Security<\/a>. By implementing Compology and rightsizing containers across 69 locations, New Market Waste saved ADT Security 53% on waste costs, while reducing carbon emissions by 15 metric tons. This is the equivalent of eliminating a garbage truck driving across the United States and back.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cIn a lot of cases, you tend to overestimate, I need this giant dumpster. I need this huge garage. I need this huge closet because you\u2019re not being efficient in your operations. You\u2019re not understanding exactly what your true needs are,\u201d said David Brightly, Director of EHS at ADT.&nbsp; \u201cCompology takes the mystery out of it. It figures out what your needs are for you so that you don\u2019t have to.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cPartnering with our customers is huge, and it allows us to not only build rapport today, but really have great trust going forward,\u201d Rob Ryan said. \u201cBeing transparent and showing them innovative technologies like Compology has really allowed us to be on the forefront of advocating for our customers and helping them meet their goals.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<section class=\"bg-white slider-component\">\n    <div class=\"container-fluid pl-0 pr-0\">\n        <div class=\"row
