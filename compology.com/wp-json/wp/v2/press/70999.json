Notable B Corps also include Athleta, Patagonia, and Lemonade. The non-profit B Lab determines B Corp certification through a rigorous audit called a B Impact Assessment to measure a company\u2019s social and environmental performance. A testament to Compology\u2019s already stringent sustainability protocols, Compology\u2019s passing score indicates it is meeting the highest standards in transparency, accountability and social impact.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Leveraging technology, Compology is helping to moderzine recycling infrastructure through innovative AI-enabled waste metering technology. Compology\u2019s waste metering technology measures and tracks waste production, allowing governments and corporations to efficiently plan waste pickups to reduce carbon emissions. In addition, its smart camera and AI-powered technology can identify contaminants in recycling streams ensuring they are removed prior to entering a recycling facility.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Compology\u2019s B Corp Certification highlights not only the company&#8217;s efforts to promote social good internally, but also showcases the company\u2019s mission to help other companies and cities meet their sustainability goals while driving cost-savings. In addition to the environmental benefits of waste metering, Compology helps companies and municipalities save an average of almost $2,000 in savings per year, per dumpster.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Compology is doing important work to help eliminate unnecessary carbon emissions,\u201d said Pooja Dindigal of B Lab. \u201cWe\u2019re thrilled Compology chose to certify as a B Corp so they can help lead the way in implementing common-sense sustainability measures and demonstrate that companies can do both good and well.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>\u201cWe are honored that our sustainability efforts have enabled us to join the ranks of B Corporations who are using business to not just drive value for shareholders but also employees, customers, society and the environment,\u201d said Jason Gates, Chief Executive Officer of Compology. \u201cThe goals of sustainability and social good drive our business each day and with our technology, Compology enables other companies and governments to reduce their carbon impact without sacrificing their financial goals.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In addition to its initial B Corp Certification, Compology is committed to continually improving its positive social impact and will recertify through the B Impact Assessment every three years to help direct its strategic growth.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>About Compology:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><p class=\"editor-header\">As the leading provider of smart camera and artificial intelligence solutions in waste and transportation, Compology helps move the world\u2019s raw material, finished goods and waste with the smallest footprint possible.
